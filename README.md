**VXWalkthroughViewController features:**

* Simple to integrate
* Uses existing localisation for configuration
* Images supported
* iPhone and iPad support

## Installation

### CocoaPods

If you want to use VXWalkthroughViewController with CocoaPods
`pod 'VXWalkthroughViewController', :head`

### Manually

* Drag the `VXWalkthroughViewController/VXWalkthroughViewController` folder into your project.
* `#import "VXWalkthroughViewController.h"`

## Usage

(see sample Xcode project in `/Demo`)

Add some steps to your `Localizable.strings` file, so it can be found using NSLocalizedString.
You can add as many steps as you like, but start at 0 and make them without steps.
If you want images, add them to your project with the predetermined names of `walkthrough_0.png`, `walkthrough_1.png`, etc.

```objective-c
"walkthrough_0" = "See No Evil";
"walkthrough_1" = "Hear No Evil";
"walkthrough_2" = "Speak No Evil";
```

Check if you should display the walkthrough in `viewDidload`:

```objective-c
if(![VXWalkthroughViewController walkthroughShown]) {
	// this is to avoid timing issues
	dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(0.1f * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
		// show the walkthrough
		[self showWalkthrough];
	});
}

```

This is the simplest way using the convenience method `VXWalkthroughModalViewController`:

```objective-c
- (void)showWalkthrough{
	UIColor *backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:167.0f/255.0f green:131.0f/255.0f blue:82.0f/255.0f alpha:1.0f];

	// create the walkthough controller
	VXWalkthroughViewController* walkthrough = [VXWalkthroughViewController initWithDelegate:self withBackgroundColor:backgroundColor];

	// show it
	[self presentViewController:walkthrough animated:YES completion:nil];
}
-(void)walkthroughCloseButtonPressed:(id)sender{
	// delegate for handling close button
	[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
```

## Release notes

### 1.0.10
Implemented suggestion of Jay Lyerly to add the option of using fullscreen images

```objective-c
	walkthrough.roundImages = NO;
	walkthrough.pageStoryboardID = @"WalkthroughPageFull";
```
